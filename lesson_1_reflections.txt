How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

If previous version did work, then bug is in the changed pieces;

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Maybe you can review what have you done: see functions usage, remember faster, but does it really worth it?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Too many versions of one file vs too little because of forgetting to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Maybe they are done for different purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

just see the changes in files and the amount of commits overall. spirl version control

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

you allready have a version that is working and it is safe.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
